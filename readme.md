# Product list
### MVP
- Define your item documents in a Mongoose model with at least a name, description and a value/price.  Your documents can be as complicated as you like.
- Make a set of RESTful routes to achieve full CRUD functionality with your items.
- On the frontend, have a main list view that shows all of your items in a table.  The table should display the value of each item, and a grand total of all of the item's value at the bottom.
- The grand total should be accurately represented at all times.
- All money values / prices should be displayed properly as currency ($99.99). With values like $10.00, you should display the two trailing zeros.  Differences smaller than a penny should be truncated or not allowed at all.
- Have an additional view to display a single item in full detail.
- Have a reasonable interface to be able to create and delete items, as well as update any value freely.
- Spend time making your app stylish, and looking nice.  Look forward to showing this off!
- Your code must be free of bugs!
- Make a readme.md to describe your app (you may like to learn a little markdown to do this).  This will be shown on your Github page.
